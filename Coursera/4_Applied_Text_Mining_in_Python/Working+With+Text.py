# # Working With Text

# In[1]:

text1 = "Ethics are built right into the ideals and objectives of the United Nations "

len(text1) # The length of text1


# In[2]:

text2 = text1.split(' ') # Return a list of the words in text2, separating by ' '.

len(text2)


# In[3]:

text2


# <br>
# List comprehension allows us to find specific words:

# In[4]:

[w for w in text2 if len(w) > 3] # Words that are greater than 3 letters long in text2


# In[5]:

[w for w in text2 if w.istitle()] # Capitalized words in text2


# In[6]:

[w for w in text2 if w.endswith('s')] # Words in text2 that end in 's'


# <br>
# We can find unique words using `set()`.

# In[7]:

text3 = 'To be or not to be'
text4 = text3.split(' ')

len(text4)


# In[8]:

len(set(text4))


# In[9]:

set(text4)


# In[10]:

len(set([w.lower() for w in text4])) # .lower converts the string to lowercase.


# In[11]:

set([w.lower() for w in text4])


# ### Processing free-text

# In[12]:

text5 = '"Ethics are built right into the ideals and objectives of the United Nations" #UNSG @ NY Society for Ethical Culture bit.ly/2guVelr'

# Finding hastags:

# In[13]:

[w for w in text6 if w.startswith('#')]


# <br>
# Finding callouts:

# In[14]:

[w for w in text6 if w.startswith('@')]


# In[15]:

text7 = '@UN @UN_Women "Ethics are built right into the ideals and objectives of the United Nations" #UNSG @ NY Society for Ethical Culture bit.ly/2guVelr'
text8 = text7.split(' ')


# <br>
# 
# We can use regular expressions to help us with more complex parsing. 
# 
# For example `'@[A-Za-z0-9_]+'` will return all words that: 
# * start with `'@'` and are followed by at least one: 
# * capital letter (`'A-Z'`)
# * lowercase letter (`'a-z'`) 
# * number (`'0-9'`)
# * or underscore (`'_'`)

# In[16]:

import re # import re - a module that provides support for regular expressions

[w for w in text8 if re.search('@[A-Za-z0-9_]+', w)]
